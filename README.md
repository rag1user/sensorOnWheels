# sensorOnWheels
A home/ office air quality sensor inspired by a battle-bot design. The bot is controlled over WiFi/ Bluetooth and roams around freely to measure air quality - temperature, humidity, air pollutants, pressure etc. Watch out and don't accidentally stomp on it please

# This is the bot that carries weather sensor around your home
